            <h2>What is the PINC program?</h2>
            <p>PINC (Promoting Inclusivity in Computing) is a program at SFSU 
                that aims to provide opportunities for Biology and Chemistry 
                majors (but all non-CS majors are welcome!) to learn about computer 
                science. The program consists of a series of 5 Computer Science 
                classes for non-CS majors (15 units total) taken over four semesters. 
                If you complete all 5 classes successfully, you will earn a minor in 
                Computing Applications. Students take classes with other biology and 
                chemistry students and are mentored by CS grad students and Biology faculty. 
                No prior computer science background needed. The PINC Summer Program 
                is a summer program for students with and without coding and research 
                experience. It runs June 3 &mdash; Aug 3 for 10 hours per week.
