            <p class="semesters_heading">CSC 308: Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Science (3 units)</p>
            <p>Introduction to the basic machine learning concepts and tools. Focuses on applying them for application development, linear model, deep neural network and transfer learning using Python, Tensorflow, and Keras.</p>
            <p class="semesters_heading">CSC 508*: Machine Learning and Data Science for Personalized Medicine (3 units)</p>
            <p>The course is both a standalone introduction to machine learning for genomic data science and a compliment to previous coursework in biology, biochemistry, or genetics. It is designed for those seeking to gain familiarity with data science and machine learning tools that enable better decision making from genomic data. Students will learn common Python tools used in genomic data science and how to apply them in real world datasets.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;"><em>*counts towards CS Senior elective</em></p>
